**Apache Bloodhound Shell Development**

Provides runtime environment for execution of apache bloodhound 0.8 during development. This does not use a WEB server (e.g. apache, nginx, etc.), it uses Python's built in web server. All examples are tested under Ubuntu 18.04.

Building (make sure you're sitting inside the directory containing the Dockerfile):

docker build . --tag bloodhound

Spinning a container based on the bloodhound image:

docker run -p 8000:8000 bloodhound

To make sure the container is up (this would look different in your environment):

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES
37d82637c5aa bloodhound "tracd --port=8000 /â€¦" 3 minutes ago Up 2 minutes 0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp hungry_shaw

To find out the IP address of the container (make sure the sha was replaced by the one you've got above):

$ docker inspect 37d82637c5aa | grep IPAddress

"SecondaryIPAddresses": null,
"IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
"IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",

To make sure the bloodhound container responds (make sure the IP was replaced by the one you've got above, as well as that you've got curl on the machine running docker):

$ curl 172.17.0.2:8000
